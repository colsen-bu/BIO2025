# Drafts Directory

This directory contains Markdown drafts of your blog posts.

## Workflow:
1. Create new post: `python3 new_post.py "Your Title"`
2. Edit the `.md` file here (much easier than HTML!)
3. Publish when ready: `python3 publish_post.py post-slug`

The `.md` files here get converted to HTML in the `posts/` directory when published.

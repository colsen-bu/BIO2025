# Image Test Post

This is a test post to verify image conversion works properly.

## Regular Image

![Test image](../media/images/BIO2025.png)

## Image with Caption

![Test image with caption](../media/images/BIO2025.png)
*This is a caption for the image above*

## Text after image

The image should display properly now instead of showing broken markdown syntax.

## Multiple Images

Here's another image:

And some text between images.

![Final test](../media/images/BIO2025.png)

The conversion should now handle all these cases correctly!

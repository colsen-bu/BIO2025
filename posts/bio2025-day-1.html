<p>Chronicling the Boston BIO 2025 conference, including the companies, the science, the activities and everything else to do and see! Come back here for regular updates and daily recaps of me shouting into the internet void with my wild takes on everything about this conference in its totality.</p>

<h2>Relaxation </h2>

<p>But before all of that, it's time to get grounded. Taking a deep breath in <em>breathes deeply</em> and out <em>releases</em>. Calmness and serenity are the keys to unlocking mental fortitude and success someone smart might have said at some point. I don't know if I believe them, but I think it's worth giving it a try! Over the course of the next few days dear reader we will embark on an expedition across the world to learn about everything the companies and the governments and the mover and shakers are doing in partnership with each other as they seek to define their future, reflect on their past, and bring ameliorative and curative treatments to market for patients.</p>

<h2>Introduction To Me</h2>

<p>However, I, dear reader, am a cynical person. While all the companies and governments in the world like to tout their beliefs in helping the sick and the poor and the hungry. That's all bullshit, they want to make money and in the case of our industry, the biotech and biopharma industry, treating and curing disease is just an easy and effective way to do that. And herein lies the dark truth which I feel has not been addressed honestly enough but leaders in the field. Doing ground-breaking research, helping sick people, all of these things may feel larger than life and many a pharma leader will plead that their company remains misunderstood and needs some sort of divine PR campaign to make the public understand that and then everything would be hunky-dory.</p>

<p>But this is not the case. A pharma company is a business, and so must operate under the strictest of economies as any business must. I believe that is the message that people should be given transparently not some mumbo jumbo about how godly the drug company is in acting on their behalf to try and help them.</p>

<p>Now that you have some insight into my fundamental dislikes about the core narratives of the industry if you'd like to continue reading about my experience at BIO2025 stay tuned for the future blog posts!(or if you're reading this in the future then continue down the rabbit hole!)</p>

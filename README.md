- Support for images and videos
- Easy publishing workflow from VS Code
- GitHub Pages ready
- Mobile-friendly

## Quick Start - Creating New Posts

### Method 1: Using VS Code Tasks (Recommended)

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select **"New Blog Post (Markdown)"**
4. Enter your post title ‚Üí Creates `.md` file in `drafts/`
5. **Edit the Markdown file** (use `Cmd+Shift+V` to preview!)

7. Use **"Push Blog to GitHub"** task to publish live

### Method 2: Using Command Line

```bash
# Create new post
python3 new_post.py "Your Post Title"

# Publish when ready
python3 publish_post.py your-post-slug

# Push to GitHub
git add . && git commit -m "New post" && git push
```

## Why This Is Better

**Before:** Writing HTML by hand üò∞
```html
<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> text with a <a href="link">link</a></p>
```

**Now:** Writing Markdown üòç  
```markdown
This is **bold** text with a [link](link)
```

## Adding Media

### Images
- Add your images to `media/images/`
- Reference with: `../media/images/filename.jpg` (from post files)
- Use the figure/figcaption structure for best styling

### Videos
- Add your videos to `media/videos/`
- Reference with: `../media/videos/filename.mp4` (from post files)
- Keep file sizes reasonable for web loading

## Publishing Workflow

1. **Create** a new post (using VS Code task or script)
2. **Edit** the post content in the generated HTML file
3. **Preview** locally (use "Preview Blog" task or open `index.html`)
4. **Publish** using the "Publish Blog" task or manually:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "New blog post: Your Title"
   git push origin main
   ```
